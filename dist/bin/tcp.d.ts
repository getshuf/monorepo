 * $ shuffle tcp <subcommand>
 *
 * Shuffle TCP is a portable TCP server that can be used to expose your Shuffle homeserver
 *
 * [!] It'll spawn a new process and run in the background until you stop it by using `shuffle tcp stop`
 *     You can also use `shuffle tcp status` to check if it's running
 *     and `shuffle tcp mp/port` to check the port it's running on
